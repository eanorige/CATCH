    Netlist Format:
        - IO Definition Reference: IO type is defined with the type parameter.
            This name must reference an IO type in the io definition file.
        - Directionality: If the IO type referenced from the io definition
            file is defined as a bidirectional IO, there is no sense of direction.
            Alternatively, if the IO is not defined as bidirectional, the
            connections are directional with block0 as the TX block and block1
            as the RX block.
        - Area for Bidirectional Cells: If there is a bidirectional IO type
            between blocks in different technology nodes it is possible the
            TX and RX sides will have different areas despite being functionally
            equivalent. In this case, the area of the bidirectional IO follows
            the same format as above, block0 will have the area defined as TX
            area in the IO definition.
        - Bandwidth: The bandwidth is defined in G-bit/s. This is the bandwidth
            of the connection in one direction for a directional connection. If
            the IO is bidirectional, this is the combined bandwidth in both
            directions. This is assumed to be symmetric so 10G-bit/s would mean
            5G-bit/s in each direction.

    Description: Define connectivity between blocks for an example design. This
            has some extra explanation below and can be used as a template for 
            defining your own designs.
