    Assembly Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Materials Cost per mm2: This is given in units of $/mm^2. This is the
            cost of the materials used in the assembly process.
        - Assembly Type: This is the type of assembly process. This is currently
            a placeholder that does not impact the result.
        - Pick and place machine cost in USD.
        - Pick and place machine lifetime in years over which the initial costs are ammortized.
        - Pick and place machine uptime as a fraction of ownership time. The value should be between 0 and 1.
        - Pick and place technician yearly cost in USD.
        - Pick and place time in seconds.
        - Pick and place group size. This is the number of chips that can be picked and placed at once.
        - Bonding machine cost in USD.
        - Bonding machine lifetime in years over which the initial costs are ammortized.
        - Bonding machine uptime as a fraction of ownership time. The value should be between 0 and 1.
        - Bonding technician yearly cost in USD.
        - Bonding time in seconds.
        - Bonding group size. This is the number of chips that can be bonded at once.
        - Die separation distance in mm.
        - Edge exclusion distance in mm.
        - Maximum pad current density in A/mm^2.
        - Bonding pitch in mm.
        - Alignment yield as a fraction between 0 and 1.
        - Bonding yield as a fraction between 0 and 1.
        - Dielectric bond defect density in units of defects/mm^2.  

    Description: Define a starter assembly process definition library for the example design.
            The actual parameters are intended to come relatively close to reasonable parameters,
            but users should replace these numbers with real numbers if they have them.
