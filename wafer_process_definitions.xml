    Wafer Process Definition Format:
        - Name: The name listed here is the name that should be referenced in the system definition.
        - Wafer Diameter: This is the diameter of the wafer in mm.
        - Edge Exclusion: This is the distance from the edge of the wafer to the first die in mm.
        - Wafer Process Yield: This is the initial yield of the wafer before individual die testing.
            It is possible this can be removed with the addition of the more sophisticated yield
            and test model.
        - Dicing Distance: This is the amount of space wasted between dies to leave room for dicing.
        - Reticle X and Y: This defines the reticle size and shape in units of mm. There are a few
            relatively standardized reticle sizes currently in use. For example, a 26x33 mm reticle.
            This does provide flexibility for defining a reticle the size of a wafer for processes
            that use one exposure per wafer or other reticle sizes currently in development.

    Description: Wafer process parameters for the example design. This can either be a unified place
            to edit parameters for all chips in the design or it can be a place to define different
            integration substrates and chips.
