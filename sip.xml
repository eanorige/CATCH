    System Definition Format:
        - Core Area: This is the area required for logic and memory. A passive
            integration substrate would have a core area of 0 since the real
            area is determined by the logic area of the dies stacked on it.
        - Buried: If this flag is true, a die does not affect the area of
            the integration substrate it is stacked on. This is useful for
            modelling EMIB.
        - Assembly Process: An assembly process should be selected from the
            assembly process file here.
        - Test Process: Select a test process from the test process file here.
            Note that this is still under development, but an update will come
            soon giving example test processes and providing support.
        - Stackup: The stackup is defined as a comma separated list of layers
            where each later starts with a number indicating how many times the
            layer is repeated. The layer name is then given after the colon.
            For example: "1:active_layer,2:advanced_metal_layer,2:intermediate_metal_layer,
            2:global_metal_layer" It is also valid to simply define a single layer.
        - Wafer Process: Select a wafer process from the wafer process file here.
        - NRE Design Cost: This is the non-recurring engineering cost for the chip.
            We plan to add more details to the NRE cost modelling support.
        - Core Voltage: This is the core voltage for the chip used to determine
            current density based on power number.
        - Power: This is the power of the chip used to determine the number of VDD/GND bumps
            along with the core voltage.
        - Quantity: This determines the ammortization of the NRE costs.
    === The next few parameters will be used in the PDN definition but are not currently supported. ===
        - V Rail: This is the voltage rail for the chip. If there are multiple
            voltage rails, they should be comma separated.
        - Regulator Efficiency: This is the efficiency of the voltage regulator
            for the chip. If there are multiple regulators, they should be comma
            separated.
        - Regulator Type: This is the type of voltage regulator for the chip.
            If there are multiple regulators, they should be comma separated. This is mean to 

        - Defining 2.5D and 3D stacks:
            - As can be seen in the design below, each chip has may contain a list of nested
                chip objects.
            - The root chip is considered to be on the bottom and each chip in its list is
                stacked directly on top of it.
            - Each of those stacked chips may also contain a list of nested chip objects
                which are stacked directly on it.

    Description: Example design definition. This can be used as a template for your designs.
            In the design below, there is a MEM chiplet 3D bonded on a CPU chiplet. That stack
            and a GPU chiplet are bonded on an interposer which is the root "chip" object in
            this system definition.
